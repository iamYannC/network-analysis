# Introduction

This folder contains the required R files as well as xlsx to run the network analysis. There is still debugging to be done, but the code is functional, and will probably not change much.

# Structure

-   [Input files](input files/)
    -   [main Excel](input files/matrixcorrect.xlsx)
    -   [All students](input files/all.csv)
    -   [Green group](input files/greens.csv)
    -   [Pink group](input files/pinks.csv)
    -   [Mixed group](input files/hetero.csv)

-   [R files](R files/)
    -   [01 CSV generator](R files/01 csv from xlsx.R)
    -   [02 Functions](R files/02 functions.R)
    -   [03 Generator](R files/03 generator.R)
    -   [Old generator](R files/old generator.R)
Currently, only old_generator is producing anything meaningful. It will be changed
-   [Output files](output files/)
    -   [All students](output files/net_all.png)
    -   [Green group](output files/net_greens.png)
    -   [Pink group](output files/net_pinks.png)
    -   [Mixed group](output files/net_hetero.png)
