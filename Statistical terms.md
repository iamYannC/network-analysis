# Social Network Analysis
Social Network Analysis refers to the study conducted with an awareness of social networks, including connections with other analysts in the field. It involves examining relationships between individuals or groups to understand patterns and dynamics within social structures.

# Centrality Measures
entrality measures refer to the evaluation of how central an individual is positioned within a social network, using tools like graph theory and network analysis. Various measures such as degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, eigenvector centrality, and Katz centrality are commonly used to analyze social influence within networks.

## Degree Centrality
Degree centrality refers to a measure in network analysis that quantifies the number of connections a node has. It is calculated based on the count of social connections (edges) a node possesses, with higher values indicating a more central position within the network.

## Eigenvector Centrality
Eigenvector centrality premises that a nodeâ€™s importance in a network may increase by having connections to the other nodes
that are themselves important and it is calculated by giving each node a relative score proportional
to the sum of the scores of its neighbours (Bonacich, 2007).
